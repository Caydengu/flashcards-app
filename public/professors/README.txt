# Professor Headshots

To add a headshot for a professor:

1.  Find a photo of the professor (e.g., `stan-1`).
2.  Save it as a `.jpg` file in this directory.
3.  Name it according to the professor's ID (e.g., `stan-1.jpg`).

## IDs
- Karen Liu: `stan-1.jpg`
- Shuran Song: `stan-2.jpg`
...and so on.

The app will automatically pick up these images. If an image is missing, it will fall back to a generated avatar.
